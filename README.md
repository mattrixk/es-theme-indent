# Indent
Theme for Emulationstation and RetroPie


##About

I wanted to try something different, so I have created the whole theme from scratch, without using other people's resources. I've been working on this theme for quite a few months... artwork takes a lot of time.

This theme supports Video View and Custom Carousel.

##Notes

- This theme has not been tested with a 4/3 ratio. You may come across some ugliness with the metadata on the Detailed view.
- This theme probably won't look very good on smaller screens (such as hand-helds) due to the amount of content on the Detailed View.
