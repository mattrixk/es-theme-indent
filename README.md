# Indent
Theme for Emulationstation and RetroPie


##About

This is a WIP. I wanted to try something different, so I have created the whole theme from scratch, without using other people's resources.

There are currently only 5 Systems supported, because they take time. I will be steadily increasing that number though.

###Supported Systems

Gameboy, NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Gamecube.

##Video

This theme has been designed to support Video Previews.

*Detailed View*

##Carousel

Zigurana has a ES Mod that lets you theme the Carousel. It's still very much WIP, but if you do use it, the Indent theme can accomodate you.

##Universal XML Scraper

The Indent theme will also include a few custom Scrape and MIX Profiles for UXS so you can scrape your <video>, <marquee> and <image> tags to look nice and pretty like the pictures. There will be RetroPie versions and Windows versions of the Profiles 

##Notes

- This theme has not been tested with a 4/3 ratio. You may come across some ugliness with the metadata on the Detailed view.
- This theme probably won't look very good on smaller screens (such as hand-helds) due to the amount of content on the Detailed View.
